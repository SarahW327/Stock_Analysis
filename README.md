# Stock_Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
#### Topic
We are trying to find the total daily volume between stocks over a period of a year.
#### Reasoning
The reasoning we are doing this is because we are trying to show users how one stock has either declined or increased percentage wise in a year. We show a comparison of 2 years and color coded the percentages for an easier read.
