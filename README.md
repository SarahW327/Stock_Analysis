# Stock_Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
#### Topic
We are trying to find the total daily volume between stocks over a period of a year.
#### Reasoning
The reasoning we are doing this is because we are trying to show users how one stock has either declined or increased percentage wise in a year. We show a comparison of 2 years and color coded the percentages for an easier read.
## Results
### 2017
In the photo below, it shows the results of the year 2017. You can see most stocks have increased in percentage and only one stock declined. It also shows how long it took for the code to run for the results.

### 2018
In the photo below, it shows the results of the year 2018. You can see most stocks have declined in percentage and only two stocks increased. It also shows how long it took for the code to run for the results.

## Summary
### Advantages/Disadvantages
Some advantages of refactoring code is you can hold more data than before and make it faster than before using a for loop and make your code more efficient by taking few steps, using less memory or improving the logic for the code for future users. 
A disadvantage is it might show back anything different.
### Pros/Cons
A pro for this refactoring this code was it made it clean and easier for future users to read and understand what is going on.
A con for this refactoring was I did not observe an changes in the time the code. I may have seen a difference if I had more data but I only have a dozen stocks, so there was very little difference.
